## My process

Going into this project I find it much easier going with the mobile-first workflow. From there I decided to work on each section of the project via the device sizing, ensuring everything is aligned and according to the sizing provided by Figma. Once the page was completed on all devices I then went on to ensure the page was responsive between the difference screen sizes. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

From working on this project one of the biggest areas I could work on even more is device responsiveness not just between mobile and desktop but also with tablet views. While media queries are very helpful I have a feeling it's not helpful in the long run and may create issues in the future. 

In addition I've been able to learn more about the units of sizing and how they can be helpful with responsive web design. When laying out everything I added everything in pixels (px) as I was going along with the Figma design that was provided. I then decided to go with view-width (vw) and percentages depending on whether I'm working with a font or div element. 

Typically I would make sure the design is responsive while I'm working between the elements but I decided to try something new by finishing everything and then work on the sizing. When I did that I realized that I had the issue of resizing all the elements and took me longer than expected to finish. But I did it and for that I bought myself some well-deserved Thai food in celebration of completing a project that challenged my CSS skills.
