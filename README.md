## Overview
This art gallery website is from the Frontend Mentor website. Frontend Mentor provides different challenges and projects for web developers to work on. There's no right or wrong answer and really encourages individual to get out of tutorial hell and put their skills to use. 


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site

## My process

Going into this project I find it much easier going with the mobile-first workflow. From there I decided to work on each section of the project via the device sizing, ensuring everything is aligned and according to the sizing provided by Figma. Once the page was completed on all devices I then went on to ensure the page was responsive between the difference screen sizes. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

From working on this project one of the biggest areas I could work on even more is device responsiveness not just between mobile and desktop but also with tablet views. While media queries are very helpful I have a feeling it's not helpful in the long run and may create issues in the future. 

In addition I've been able to learn more about the units of sizing and how they can be helpful with responsive web design. When laying out everything I added everything in pixels (px) as I was going along with the Figma design that was provided. I then decided to go with view-width (vw) and percentages depending on whether I'm working with a font or div element. 

Typically I would make sure the design is responsive while I'm working between the elements but I decided to try something new by finishing everything and then work on the sizing. When I did that I realized that I had the issue of resizing all the elements and took me longer than expected to finish. But I did it and for that I bought myself some well-deserved Thai food in celebration of completing a project that challenged my CSS skills. 

I also am realizing that I have a lot of font sizes that change and I don't think having defaults was really helpful. This was mainly due to going to EXACTLY what the Figma design asked for to make sure it's as identical as I can. 

Lastly, I wanted to add the extra challenge and add an API map for the location. While I found it exciting and cool to learn a new skill I wasn't able to complete it due to having to add billing information via Google cloud and I wasn't sure whether to add it or not. I didn't want to be charged so I opted not to and just added photos. Nevertheless I added the API information in the code. 

All in all my skills are getting better but I do believe the bigger the project the more I will need to clean up my code.
